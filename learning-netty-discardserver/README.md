## Discard Server

The most simplistic protocol in the world is not 'Hello, World!' but DISCARD. It's a protocol that discards any received data without any response.

To implement the DISCARD protocol, the only thing you need to do is to ignore all received data. Let us start straight from the handler implementation, which handles I/O events generated by Netty.

However, in order to display the message received, I print the massage in handler.

So, you can enter `telnet localhost 8080` in terminal, and then you can use it~
